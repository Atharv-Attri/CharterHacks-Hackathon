## About the app
### Abstract
Introducing Not Me, a contact tracing app, and the only contact tracing app that doesn't need to know any of your personal information. In Most U.S. states, there is either no contact tracing, or contact tracing is done through calls. This leaves a lot of room for errors, and many people forget where they have been. Think about it, do you rememeber where you were 5 days ago? A contact tracing app reduces the chances for errors. If even one positive person uses a contact tracing app, they could save hundreds of lives. But most people don't like using a contact tracing app because they worry for their privacy. We are trying to fix this. Why should a person have to decide between saving lives and and their privacy? So we made Not Me.

### What the app does
Not Me is a contact tracing app like no other. Most contact tracing apps require data like your address, your phone number, your email, and sometimes even your government id. Not me doesn't require any of that. It just takes your location (NOTE to Judges, we have disabled tracking because we don't want to know where you live). You don't ever need to provide any other information, and your location is anonomyous, we don't know who your are. You can view and edit all your data at your comfort, and if you don't want us to know a specific place you have been, you can delete it at the click of a button.

### About the code
This is a flask app, and it is a web dashboard. It will connect with with your phone (not included with the app), and will follow CDC's guidlines on how to track. 

## Questions
### What is the purpose of your app and how does it address the prompt?
The purpose of our app is to provide people with the service of contact tracing that doesn't infringe on their privacy. This addresses the prompt of Covid-19, health, and healthcare, because our contact tracing could help save many lives and stop the spread of Covid-19. Since our contact tracing protects people's privacy, this effectively means that more people would be willing to use contact tracing and therefore save lives. 

### Who is the audience of your app and who will be using it?
The audience of our app is the general public and they are the very same people who will be using it. We want as many people as possible to use the app so that our data can be as specific as possible in giving people information on whether or not they could have been infected. 
### What challenges did you overcome in making your project?
One of the biggest challenges we encountered, was having Google's API to work in our web app. We also had a lot of trouble in getting our login and register pages to work properly while also being secure. Finally, the biggest problem we encountered was trying to finish our project on time. It was really difficult to stick to the many schedules that we made and there was a lot of stress and anxiety involved when problems showed up that forced us off our tight schedule. Due to this, we had to remove some functionalilities and decide what was core to our app.
